# OneHub Engineering REST API

## Overview
OneHub Engineering is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot. This project serves as the backend for managing employee data, providing an endpoint for adding a new employee.

## Features
- RESTful API endpoint for managing employees
- Validation of input data
- Error handling
- Integration with a database using Spring Data JPA

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Chosen for its reliability, platform independence, and extensive ecosystem.
- **Maven:** Used for project management and dependency resolution, ensuring smooth build and deployment processes.
- **Spring Boot:** Utilized for rapid API development with minimal configuration, leveraging Spring's dependency injection and auto-configuration features.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Integrated for easy implementation of data persistence and CRUD operations.
- **H2 Database:** Employed as an in-memory database for development and testing purposes, ensuring lightweight and efficient data storage.

## RESTful API Design

Our API is designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, adhering to RESTful principles:
- **Endpoint:** `/api/employees` allows HR administrators to add a new employee with essential details.
- **HTTP Method:** Supports `POST` for creating a new resource.
- **Request Body:** Expects JSON payload containing employee details (title, firstname, surname, dob, gender, email, address).
- **Response:** Returns the created employee's details with HTTP status `201 Created`.  

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Java 11 installed
- Maven installed

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onehub-engineering.git
   cd onehub-engineering

## Configure the database
Update the src/main/resources/application.properties file with your database configuration:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdbname
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

## Build the project

```mvn clean install```

## Run the application

```mvn spring-boot:run```

## Usage

The API provides endpoints for managing employees. Below are the available endpoints:

- Create a new employee
  
```POST /api/employees```

    {
        "employeeNo": "123",
        "firstname": "John",
        "surname": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }

This can be run via postman at http://localhost:8080/api/employees

## Using cURL

- Create a new employee

    ```curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/employees -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"employeeNo":"123","firstname":"John","surname":"Doe","email":"john.doe@example.com"}'```

## Given More Time

With additional time, there are several areas we could focus on to further enhance and refine our project:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Implement more robust error handling and validation mechanisms. Ensure all input data is thoroughly validated, and appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes are returned.

2. **Authentication and Security:**
   - Integrate authentication mechanisms to secure our API endpoints, particularly when handling sensitive employee information. Explore frameworks like Spring Security for user access management.

3. **Additional CRUD Operations:**
   - Expand the API to include more CRUD operations for managing employee data:
     - **Read Operations:** Implement endpoints to fetch employee details by ID, list all employees, and search/filter employees based on various criteria.
     - **Update Operations:** Add endpoints to update employee information, such as name, email, address, etc.
     - **Delete Operations:** Include endpoints to delete employees from the system.

4. **Unit and Integration Testing:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate service layer logic, controller endpoints, and data access. Incorporate integration tests to verify interactions between components.

5. **Data Persistence and Transactions:**
   - Optimize data persistence strategies, including transaction management and database optimizations. Consider implementing caching mechanisms for improved performance.

6. **API Documentation and Swagger Integration:**
   - Document API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Springfox. This will provide clear documentation for developers on how to interact with our API effectively.

7. **Refactoring and Code Quality:**
   - Refactor codebase to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards. Eliminate code duplication, apply design patterns, and reorganize project structure as needed.

8. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Implement logging throughout the application to capture important events and errors. Integrate with monitoring tools to track performance metrics and ensure application stability.

9. **Deployment and CI/CD:**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment processes. Automate deployment across environments to streamline development and delivery cycles.

10. **Scalability and Performance Optimization:**
    - Evaluate and optimize application scalability and performance. Conduct load testing, database tuning, and explore techniques for horizontal scaling as necessary.

11. **User Interface Development (if applicable):**
    - Collaborate with frontend engineers to integrate backend API with user interface components. Ensure API responses meet frontend requirements and handle edge cases effectively.
